### About me:

In 2015 I graduated from the Bryansk State Technical University with a degree in Industrial Energy. <br>
While studying at the university I started working in a company that develops heat supply, water supply, gas supply schemes for cities and conducts energy audits.<br> I still work in this company as a lead engineer.<br> My job responsibilities include leading the project from the signing of the contract until the completion of the work. <br> In general I like my job and I'm competent in many things related to it. <br> It's not difficult for me because I have a technical mindset. <br> After a long period of work, I realized that I didn't see any prospects for myself in this specialty, and I wanted to develop in a completely  new direction. <br> I accidentallyheard about The Rolling Scopes School. I read the program and signed up for a "JavaScript/Front-end".<br>
I want to take a js-frontend course at The Rolling Scopes School, and
I believe in myself and my skills.<br> So that soon my web developer skills will be enough to change my profession and have prospects for further development.
